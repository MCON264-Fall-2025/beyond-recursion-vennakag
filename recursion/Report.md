Fibonacci Program:

    Recursive = Time was much longer and started to even take a few seconds once it reached 45. The program even stopped by 48 saying: "computation is getting too expensive - stopping demo."
    Iterative = Time was much quicker. The program worked very smoothly with all numbers.

Linked List Insertion Program:

    Recursive = resulted in stack overflow
    Iterative = program ran smoothly and quickly.
